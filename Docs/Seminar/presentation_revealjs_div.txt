    <div style="text-align: center;">An English school boy does "grammar" as an analytical exercise, but the foreign student needs to learn the mechanics of the language [Allen 1960].</div>

    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="font: inherit;">Target audience are students of English as a second language&nbsp;(If it wasn't clear by now..),&nbsp;targeting late teens and up.&nbsp;</div>

    <h2>So what's out there now?</h2>
    <div style="text-align: left;">Numerous websites with practical content of all sorts, including dedicated games for practicing English (quizlet.com).</div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">However, due to their generic nature, they lack two crucial components:</div>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Ability to track mistakes and provide real time feedback regarding those mistakes.</li>
            <li>The immersion you receive when working with a dedicated system.</li>
